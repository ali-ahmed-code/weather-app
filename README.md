##  Important Note
The original OpenWeather API key used in this project has been **revoked for security purposes** to prevent unauthorized usage.  
If you would like to test the app locally:
1. Create a free account at [OpenWeatherMap](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up).
2. Generate your own API key.
3. Open the `script.js` file and replace this line:
   ```javascript
   const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";
